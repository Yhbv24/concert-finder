## About

On a recent trip through San Francisco, I wanted to check out what shows were in the area. However, I didn't know a resource or the names of local venues to search. I decided to create a little web app that would allow me to type in a location (currently, zip code, will be cities/towns soon), radius, start, and end date, and it would return the results in an easy to view list.

This is the result. It's pretty basic, but suits what I was looking for. A simple web app that will allow me to see shows and purchase tickets to those shows.

## Technologies Used

* PHP
* HTML
* SASS
* JamBase API

## Setup Instructions

To use this web app, you will need to create your own JamBase API. However, you're welcome to clone the repo and run it.
